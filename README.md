# ahk_WAN_Getter
# SCRIPT NAME: wan_ip_address_getter_v6.ahk

This is an AHK script that records the DHCP WAN IP address on my office public gateway. I needed a way to see my WAN IP address available when I travel, so I can remote into my server in my office and I don't want a static IP address. The solution is here. When the IP address is copied to the txt file, it is saved to my Dropbox account, so I  can get it remotely. Below are main comments in the script.

BUGS/ISSUES/COMMENT: 
1. The script runs fine, ECXCEPT when the system logs the user off. There is a solution to this. Keep logoff.bat file in the same directory as the WAN_IP.txt file, and use it to log out of the system when you are done, instead of RDP close. This will keep the user session active, and not lock the machine, and the script will continue to run.
2. A windows machine needs to reboot periodically, so use the reboot.ahk script for this purpose. You can also place wan_ip_address_getter_v6.ahk in the startup directory of the server.
